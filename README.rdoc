== README

This project is to get the hang of the imsas api for a project i've been asked to work on

necessary functionality so far:

* Get background check info about user from api

* assign a score to different crimes

* approve or deny based on that score



I'll also wrap the imsas api into a ruby gem to make thing easier for myself and maybe other developers that want to use this api in rails
